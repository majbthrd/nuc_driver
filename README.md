NUC121/NUC125/NUC126 driver files for TinyUSB
=============================================

[TinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) relies on driver files that are loaded as submodules.

These files are derived from:

[https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/NUC121_125BSP](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/NUC121_125BSP)
[https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/NUC126BSP](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/NUC126BSP)

Modifications were minimal; unnecessary files were removed, and source code was tweaked to compile without errors.
